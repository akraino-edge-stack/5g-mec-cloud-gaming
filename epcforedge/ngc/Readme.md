# 2. Prerequisites
## OS
- CentOS (7.6.1810)

## Tools
- `make` (version 3.81 or higher)
- `golang` (version 1.12.4)
- `openssl` (version 1.0.2 or higher)
- `curl` (version 7.29.0 or higher)

# 3. Quick Start
## OAM
### Build

To build oam:

```sh
make oam
```
Generated bin will be put under `ngc/dist`

### Configure and Run OAM Bin

OAM Config Example File - `oam.json` locates at `ngc/configs`

The configurable parameters list:

| Param          | Description                                                                   |

| OpenEndpoint   | HTTP2 EndPoint. Used by CNCA to access OAM via HTTP2                          |
| NgcEndpoint    | NGC EndPoint. Used by OAM to access NGC                                       |
| NgcType        | NGC Type. Now only support APISTUB test mode.                                 |
| NgcTestData    | NGC TestData Path. Used by APISTUB testdata                                   |

| ServerKeyPath  | Path to keys used by OAM server for HTTP2 connection between CNCA/UI and OAM  |

To run oam, just execute as below:
```sh
./oam
```

> NOTE: The OAM bin will load configuration from `configs/oam.json`, so before execution please have nef configuration file in the configs folder

### OAM Unit and API Testing

The Unit and API Testing should be performed in a local development environment. 

To run only unit tests and generate coverage report:
```sh
make test-unit-oam
```

> NOTE: Before executing unit test, need to install ginkgo as below:

```sh
$ go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
$ go get github.com/onsi/gomega/...
```


To run API Testing:

Step 1: Run OAM with NgcType as `APISTUB`.

Step 2: Run Curl Test Scripts to simulate HTTP Request to OAM.
```sh
cd ngc/test/oam/cnca-cli-scripts
./runAll.sh
```
> NOTE: Can use ./runAll.sh to run all methods testing automatically. Also can use ./cliTest.shto run different method manually.

#### Run NEF
To run nef, just execute as below:
```sh
./nef
```
> NOTE: 
1. The NEF will load configuration from `/configs/nef.json`, so before execution please have nef configuration file in the configs folder
2. The NEF certificates need to be available in the location mentioned in the configuration

### NEF Unit and API Testing

The Unit and API Testing should be performed in a local development environment. 

To run only unit tests and generate coverage report:
```sh
make test-unit-nef
```

> NOTE: Before executing unit test, need to install ginkgo as below:

```sh
$ go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
$ go get github.com/onsi/gomega/...
```
To run API Testing:

Step 1 : Change to the nef folder
```sh
cd ngc/test/nef/nef-cli-scripts
```
Step 2 : Run Curl Test Scripts to simulate HTTP Request to NEF.

## Lint

```sh
make lint
```
> NOTE: Need to install golangci-lint as below:
```sh
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh| sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin v1.21.0
```

## make help
IMPORTANT: understand make options by this help command.


## Certifications Generation

To generate certifications for TLS, can use shell script - `genCerts.sh` in `ngc/scripts`. 
Can get detail usage by executing the script as: `./genCerts.sh ?` .

## OAuth2

The OAuth2 is a go package used by NEF and AF for OAuth2 token generation and verification. By default OAuth2 is enabled between AF and NEF. OAuth2 can be disabled by respectinve AF and NEF component configuration.Â
