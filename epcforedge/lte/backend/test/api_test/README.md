# api_test

This is the CURL based test scripts for CUPS API testing (HTTP based)


## Overview

- If OAMAgent and CURL TestScripts will run on the same server, you will need to add hostname "epc.oam" into /etc/hosts 127.0.0.1 entry
- If OAMAgent and CURL TestScripts will run on the different servers, you will need to add hostname "epc.oam" into /etc/hosts on the CURL Test scripts Server. 
  And the IP address should be OAMAgent's IPAddress
